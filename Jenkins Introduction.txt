1. What is Jenkins?
Ans. CI(Continuous Integration) Tool or Build Tool

------------------------------------------------------

2. What is CI?
Ans. Automated Build + Automated Testing (Not Manual Build and Testing) -----> After Build ----> Get Imediate Feedback (Through Mail)
     It's a process to setup a automated build and testing and get imediate feedback from it.
     Feedback is important but it's success or faild it's doesn't matter. 
     It's matter to developer if it's getting the feedback imediately so that they can work on it.

3. SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) PHASE?
Ans. -> PLAN (System Design and Analysis) --> ARCH Team 
     -> CODE (Development)  --> Dev Team
     -> CODE REVIEW --> Dev Team
     -> BUILD --> Dev Team
     -> UNIT TESTING --> Dev Team
     -> Packaging (System and Application Packaging) --> Dev Team
     -> Archiving (Store all the packages at one place) --> Dev Team
     -> Deployment (On QA Envirnoment) --> QA Team
     -> Acceptance Testing --> QA Team
     -> Code Coverage --> QA Team

4. What do we want?
Ans. Automation (No Manual Work)
						
     -> PLAN (System Design and Analysis) --> (Automation not possible)
     -> CODE (Development)  --> Dev Team --> (Automation not possible)
     -> CODE REVIEW --> Dev Team --> (Automation Possible)
     -> BUILD --> Dev Team --> (Automation Possible)
     -> UNIT TESTING --> Dev Team --> (Automation Possible)
     -> Packaging (System and Application Packaging) --> Dev Team --> (Automation Possible)
     -> Archiving (Store all the packages at one place) --> Dev Team --> (Automation Possible)
     -> Deployment (On QA Envirnoment) --> QA Team --> (Automation Possible)
     -> Acceptance Testing --> QA Team --> (Automation Possible)
     -> Code Coverage --> QA Team --> (Automation Possible)

     Only Feedback is required if any one of the above mentioned phases is failed due to some error.
     ALL PASS --> Release
     ONE FAILED --> Repeat All the Step
